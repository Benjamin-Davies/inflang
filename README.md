# Inflang

A joke language where everything can be, and will be, an infix operator. So infix, in fact, that the syntax penetrates individual words to become the vowels. This use of vowels to change the meaning of a word is partially inspired by [Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Hebrew_verbs).

## Usage

You will need to have NodeJS installed.

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm i

# Transpile to TypeScript
npx ts-node transpiler examples/fazz-buzz.inf

# Run the example
npx ts-node examples/fazz-buzz.ts
```

## Syntax

See [examples/fazz-buzz.inf] for a brief overview of the syntax.
